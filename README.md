# SignalFrame | Prompt Systems Archive

This archive contains versioned, tested, and structured prompt systems authored by SignalFrame.  
Each system is maintained with version history, test logs, and case study documentation.

## Current Systems

### üè• EMR Nurse Triage Summary
- **Purpose:** Extract structured clinical data from triage notes for physician review in EMR systems.  
- **Baseline:** v3.62_Locked (2025-08-23)  
- **Testing:** Passed compliance across GPT-4o, Claude 3.5, Gemini 2.5 Flash, and Perplexity. Verified med-effect edge cases (captured when present, omitted when absent).  
- **Failure history:** v1.0 archived ‚Äî paraphrasing and over-labeling observed. v1.4_Locked corrected these issues. v3.6 failed on GPT-4o (missing Nurse observations) and Gemini (dropped med effect). v3.61 fixed GPT-4o; v3.62 fixed Gemini.  
- **Folder:** [`systems/emr-triage-summary`](systems/emr-triage-summary)

### üìÑ Legal Contract Clause Extractor
- **Purpose:** Extract obligations, restrictions, and renewal/termination clauses from contract text.  
- **Baseline:** v2.9_Locked  
- **Testing:** Passed compliance across GPT-4o, Claude 3.5, Gemini 2.5 Flash, and Perplexity. All models produced identical, verbatim outputs.  
- **Failure history:** v2.7 archived ‚Äî failed due to paraphrasing, truncation, and Gemini commentary drift. Hardened into v2.9_Locked.  
- **Folder:** [`systems/legal-contract-extractor`](systems/legal-contract-extractor)

## Versioning Policy
- **Locked versions** (e.g., `v1.4_Locked`, `v2.9_Locked`) represent hardened, tested baselines safe for public use.  
- **Earlier versions** are archived for transparency but are not intended for production use.  
- Failure versions (e.g., EMR v1.0, Legal v2.7) are explicitly preserved to document known weaknesses and the fixes applied.  

---

## Testing
- Each locked version undergoes adversarial and multi-model compliance testing.  
- Results are stored in system-specific `tests/` folders.  
- Logs record pass/fail outcomes, format compliance, and hallucination control.
