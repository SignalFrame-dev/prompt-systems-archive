# Dash Prompt Systems | SignalFrame Archive

Dash Prompt Systems is a library of unbreakable, domain-specific prompt systems designed by SignalFrame. Each system is versioned, stress-tested across major models, and includes constraint logic for hallucination prevention, format enforcement, and model compliance.

Systems are tested against:
