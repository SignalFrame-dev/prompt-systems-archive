Hereâ€™s a polished README draft tailored to your repo: `prompt-systems-archive`.

# ðŸ§  SignalFrame Prompt Systems Archive

**Author:** SignalFrame
**Mission:** Architecting unbreakable prompts for high-stakes, multi-model AI deployments.

---

## ðŸ“œ Purpose

This archive showcases versioned prompt systems designed for hallucination control, cross-model stability, and scope-constrained information extraction. Each prompt has been rigorously tested against modern LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o, Claude 3.5, Gemini 1.5 Pro, GPT-3.5) and passed multi-round adversarial QAâ€”including manual red-team trials.

---

## ðŸ“‚ Structure

* `case-study-1_emr-triage-extractor/`
  High-reliability template for extracting vitals, symptoms, and risk factors from nurse triage notes.
  Designed for EMR integration in clinical workflows.

* `case-study-2_legal-contract-extractor/`
  Format-heavy prompt for extracting obligations, restrictions, and renewal terms from policy and contract text.
  Tuned for legal hallucination sensitivity and ambiguity filtering.

Each case study folder includes:

* âœ… Final versioned prompt
* ðŸ“‹ QA summary
* ðŸ§ª Output samples across models
* ðŸ§  Design rationale and version notes

---

## ðŸ”’ Design Principles

* **No hallucinations permitted.**
* **Scope â‰  Summary.** Extraction is bound strictly to input content.
* **Failure â‰  Incompletion.** Returning nothing is acceptableâ€”and expectedâ€”if conditions are unmet.
* **Cross-model compliance.** Prompts are optimized to survive architecture differences without drift.
* **Version discipline.** Each system is traceable through its development lifecycle.

---

## ðŸš§ In Development

Upcoming releases will include:

* Advanced scoring rubrics for prompt evaluation
* Additional extractors (e.g., medical discharge, compliance filters)
* Python + API orchestration workflows
* A reference library of reusable prompt components

---

## ðŸ“Ž Attribution

These systems were authored by SignalFrame, guided by an AI-native protocol for high-precision prompt engineering.
This repository serves as a public ledger of transparent, replicable AI instructionsâ€”built to raise the bar.
