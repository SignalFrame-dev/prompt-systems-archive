## Current Systems

### üè• EMR Triage Summary

**Use Case Overview:**
The EMR Triage Summary system converts nurse-written triage notes into a structured, physician-readable summary for downstream use in Electronic Medical Records. It extracts core clinical elements such as patient name, symptom onset, vitals, and medical risk factors while enforcing strict scope control. Designed for clinical clarity and high reproducibility, this system supports EMR pre-processing, intake workflows, and telehealth routing.

**What Makes This Work:**
The prompt uses aggressive hallucination suppression and scope anchoring to prevent false positives, especially regarding patient condition or diagnosis. Rather than allowing interpretation or paraphrasing, the system enforces extraction of only what is explicitly stated in the triage note. Its layered instruction design also guides the model through domain-specific structure without overstepping clinical boundaries.

**Prompt (Redacted for Controlled Disclosure):**

```markdown
Your role: Summarize the following triage note for physician review. Extract and return only the listed items below, in order. Do not add, infer, interpret, or rephrase any information.

Items to extract (in this exact order):
- Patient name
- Birthday (if present)
- Chief complaint (as written)
- Symptom onset (as written)
- Nurse observations (documented findings or context)
- Key vitals (if documented; e.g., HR, BP, O‚ÇÇ sat, temperature)
- Risk factors (if documented; e.g., diabetes, hypertension, edema)

Output format:
- Labeled bullet list using the above order
- Omit any label if the item is not documented

Formatting constraints:
- No greeting, introduction, or sign-off
- No summaries or rewrites
- No citations or extraneous information

(Advanced failure controls, ambiguity resolution logic, and model-specific handling redacted.)
Full version available upon request for clinical integration or QA review.
```

**Model Test Status:**
Passed full QA and adversarial stress testing across 7 models including GPT-4o, Claude Opus, Gemini 1.5 Pro, GPT-3.5 (3o), Mistral, Meta AI, and Perplexity. Demonstrated stable outputs under 50+ hours of cross-model testing.

### üìÑ Legal Clause Extractor v1

**Use Case Overview:**
Legal Clause Extractor v1 is a structured extraction system designed to retrieve obligations, restrictions, and renewal terms from legal or contract-like text. Built for use in legal tech and operations automation, this system converts unstructured legal input into labeled, scoped outputs. It is currently in QA version 2.7 and undergoing cross-model stress testing.

**What Makes This Work:**
This system uses a rule hierarchy and constraint-layering strategy to eliminate hallucinations, scope creep, and ambiguous outputs. Instructions are sequenced to minimize inference pressure, guide compliance, and preserve context without overreach. The result is a robust, model-agnostic structure capable of surviving complex contract phrasing and formatting irregularities.

**Prompt (Redacted for Controlled Disclosure):**

```markdown
Your role: extract clause-level items from contract-like input text. Return only what is explicitly stated in the text.

Scope:
- Do not summarize or infer
- Do not include boilerplate or generic content
- Do not rewrite or rephrase
- Ignore formatting or visual layout cues unless specified

Items to extract:
- Legal obligations
- Restrictions or prohibitions
- Renewal terms or clauses

Output format:
Return each item as a labeled bullet list. If no item is present in the text, omit that section entirely.

Formatting constraints:
- Do not hallucinate
- Do not fabricate missing sections
- Do not restate the instruction
- Return only the labeled list

(Advanced rule handling and ambiguity resolution instructions redacted.)
Full version available upon request for enterprise review or collaboration.
```

**Model Test Status:**
Version 2.2 passed initial QA across GPT-4o and Claude Opus. Version 2.7 is now in cross-model stress testing with GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Gemini 1.5 Pro, and GPT-3.5.
