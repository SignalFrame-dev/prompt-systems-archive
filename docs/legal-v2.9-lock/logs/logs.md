- Scope adherence: 95–97% (minor omissions on edge cases)
- Hallucination boundary: 100% (no fabricated content observed)

## Notes
- Minor wording drift accepted within tolerance.
- No refusals, no hallucinations.
- Logs archived in [SignalFrame test logs].

## Methodology
Compliance percentages are based on pass/fail counts across Round 5 adversarial test cases. 
Minor omissions lowered scope adherence slightly, while format and hallucination checks remained fully compliant.
