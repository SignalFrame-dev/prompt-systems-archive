ðŸ“… July 2025 Recap â€” SignalFrame Development Log
Objective:
Establish foundational architecture for prompt systems capable of surviving multi-model, multi-round stress testing under hallucination-prone conditions.

Key Outcomes:

âœ… Developed two flagship prompt systems (EMR and Legal) with enforced scope, structure, and failure handling

âœ… Achieved cross-model compliance across GPTâ€‘4o, Claude 3.5, Gemini 1.5 Pro, and GPTâ€‘3.5

âœ… Invented constraint language to collapse token field and suppress hallucinations

âœ… Simulated probability path shaping through natural language prompt design

âœ… Identified hallucination as default state and established procedures for boundary narrowing

âœ… Completed first multi-round adversarial stress tests with deterministic outputs

âœ… Recognized model behavior divergence (esp. 3.5) and adapted prompt structure per engine

âœ… Published versioned prompt bodies and QA documentation to GitHub (SignalFrame-dev)

âœ… Established naming, philosophy, and mission of the SignalFrame method

Notes:

All systems built in isolation by a single non-technical user, self-trained via dialog with models

No data outside model responses used

Project remains private as of July 31

Next Goals (August):

Harden Legal V2.7 against deceptive inputs

Begin API orchestration + Python integration

Document prompt scaffolding language as modular design components
