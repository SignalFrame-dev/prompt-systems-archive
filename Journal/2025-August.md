📅 August 2025 — SignalFrame Development Log
Mission:
Advance SignalFrame from prompt architecture to pipeline orchestration, integrating system prompts with code execution and API interaction. Begin shaping a full-stack methodology for LLM control and deployment.

August Focus Areas:

🧠 Prompt → Python translation (scoring functions, audits, token path tracking)

🔌 API calling and response handling

🧪 Continued stress testing for Legal V2.7 under deceptive and edge-case inputs

🧭 Model-specific optimization blocks (Gemini, GPT-3.5)

🗂️ Expand GitHub documentation to include method principles and changelogs

🔒 Secure provenance of intellectual process (timestamped logs, structured commits)

End-of-Month Goal:
Functional Python + API harness that scores, audits, and routes model outputs across systems—built entirely from scratch by a non-programmer, using only natural language, logic, and version control.
