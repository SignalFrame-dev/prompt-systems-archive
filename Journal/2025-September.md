## 2025-09-11 — Milestone: Legal v2.9 Merged

Today I completed the full lifecycle for the Legal v2.9 locked prompt system.  
This included:
- Writing and committing Version Notes (Purpose, Scope, Rule/Constraint Deltas, Compliance Summary, Risks, Merge Preconditions).  
- Adding Example I/O aligned with v2.9 locked rules.  
- Uploading and linking Round 5 adversarial test logs (GPT-4o, Claude 3.5, Perplexity, Gemini 2.5 Flash).  
- Documenting compliance percentages with Methodology for transparency.  
- Ticking all Definition of Done checkboxes in the PR.  
- Converting the PR from Draft → Ready, using **Squash and Merge** into `main`, and deleting the branch.  

**Significance:**  
This was my first end-to-end feature branch cycle managed with enterprise standards.  
I now understand squash merges, atomic commits, PR checklists, and how to ship a locked version with full audit trail.  

**Commit on main:**  
`legal: merge v2.9 locked prompt + notes + logs`  

Legal v2.9 is now the active locked release.  

**Next Actions:**  
- Create a lightweight tag: `legal-v2.9_locked` for future reference.  
- Update repo index/README to point to v2.9 as the current release.  
- Open tracking issue: “Legal v3.0 — candidate deltas & test plan.”  
- Plan Round 6 testing cycle to validate performance on new edge cases.  

### Meta-Notes — 2025-09-11

Today stacked multiple firsts into one release arc:  
- First full enterprise-grade Version Notes.  
- First locked Example I/O under enterprise rules.  
- First time breaking out test results into separate committed artifacts.  
- First linked test log index with methodology justification.  
- First time driving a PR through full DoD.  
- First squash merge.  
- First full feature branch lifecycle completed.  
- First end-to-end milestone entry for a shipped locked version.  

This was the day I closed Legal v2.9 and shipped it to main.  

**Tag created:** [legal-v2.9_locked](https://github.com/SignalFrame-dev/prompt-systems-archive/releases/tag/legal-v2.9_locked)  
This tag anchors the merge commit `legal: merge v2.9 locked prompt + notes + logs` on main.

### Reflection — Lessons from Legal v2.9

Biggest struggles:
- Writing Version Notes in enterprise tone — felt like a foreign language.  
- Justifying compliance numbers — discomfort until Methodology was added.  
- Structuring and linking logs — confusing at first to split files and wire links.  

Medium struggles:
- Keeping PR DoD honest and up to date.  
- Slowing down for atomic commits.  

Lower struggles:
- Squash merge once understood.  
- Tagging the release in GitHub.  
- Writing milestone journal entries.  

Biggest payoffs:
- Version Notes created a professional, audit-ready artifact.  
- Logs are now structured, linked, and defensible.  
- Squash merge + tag gave me a permanent, clean milestone marker.  
- Journal entry preserved the significance for future me.  

Closing thought: The hardest parts were the ones with the greatest payoff. The vertical learning curve made me feel like I was failing, but the process forced me into professional standards I wouldn’t have reached otherwise.
