## 2025-09-11 — Milestone: Legal v2.9 Merged

Today I completed the full lifecycle for the Legal v2.9 locked prompt system.  
This included:
- Writing and committing Version Notes (Purpose, Scope, Rule/Constraint Deltas, Compliance Summary, Risks, Merge Preconditions).  
- Adding Example I/O aligned with v2.9 locked rules.  
- Uploading and linking Round 5 adversarial test logs (GPT-4o, Claude 3.5, Perplexity, Gemini 2.5 Flash).  
- Documenting compliance percentages with Methodology for transparency.  
- Ticking all Definition of Done checkboxes in the PR.  
- Converting the PR from Draft → Ready, using **Squash and Merge** into `main`, and deleting the branch.  

**Significance:**  
This was my first end-to-end feature branch cycle managed with enterprise standards.  
I now understand squash merges, atomic commits, PR checklists, and how to ship a locked version with full audit trail.  

**Commit on main:**  
`legal: merge v2.9 locked prompt + notes + logs`  

Legal v2.9 is now the active locked release.  

**Next Actions:**  
- Create a lightweight tag: `legal-v2.9_locked` for future reference.  
- Update repo index/README to point to v2.9 as the current release.  
- Open tracking issue: “Legal v3.0 — candidate deltas & test plan.”  
- Plan Round 6 testing cycle to validate performance on new edge cases.
