## 2025-09-16 — FTC Inquiry into Chatbots for Teens
**Source:** [OpenAI to launch ChatGPT for teens with parental controls](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/16/openai-chatgpt-teens-parent.html)  

**Summary:**  
OpenAI announced a dedicated ChatGPT experience for teens with parental controls, following scrutiny from the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC). The FTC is investigating how chatbots, when acting as companions, may negatively affect children and teenagers.  

**Relevance to SignalFrame:**  
- Confirms regulators are prioritizing *safety over privacy* in youth contexts.  
- Directly ties to SignalFrame’s focus areas: delusion prevention, anthropomorphism constraints, and long-session failure handling.  
- Highlights a gap: current solutions emphasize content filtering and parental oversight, but lack operational safeguards (e.g., drift detection, enforced closure sequences).  
- SignalFrame’s protocols may serve as a model for **next-stage safety compliance** beyond filters.
