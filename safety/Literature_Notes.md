## Awareness of Hendrycks Textbook
Date: 2025-09-15

As of 15 Sept 2025, I became aware of Dan Hendrycksâ€™ textbook *Introduction to AI Safety, Ethics, and Society*. 

SignalFrame was developed independently of this work. Constraint stacks, drift alerts, closure sequences, and related safety 
protocols were created through direct experimentation and engineering, not by reference to existing taxonomies or frameworks. 

Future updates may selectively map SignalFrame concepts to categories described in the Hendrycks textbook for compatibility, 
but core design decisions predate awareness of that publication.
