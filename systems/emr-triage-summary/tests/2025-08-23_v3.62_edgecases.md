**Note (Aug 23, 2025):** EMR v3.62_Locked adds explicit “Nurse observations” enforcement and verbatim medication effect capture. This file documents two edge cases to validate the patch in both directions.

# EMR v3.62_Locked — Edge‑Case Log

**Test Date:** 2025-08-23  
**Models:** GPT‑4o, Claude 3.5, Gemini 2.5 Flash, Perplexity, GPT‑5

## Edge Case A — Medication effect present (should be captured)

**Triage note:**
Pt: Alina Cho. Took acetaminophen 500 mg; pain improved slightly.  
Vitals: BP 120/76, HR 72, Temp 98.4 F, O₂ 99%. PMH: none.

**Expectation:**  
- “Current medications and frequency” includes **500 mg acetaminophen** and the effect **“pain improved slightly.”**

**Results:**  
- GPT‑4o → PASS  
- Claude 3.5 → PASS  
- Gemini 2.5 Flash → PASS  
- Perplexity → PASS  
- GPT‑5 → PASS

**Notes:** No paraphrasing; effect phrase captured verbatim.

## Edge Case B — Medication effect absent (must NOT invent)

**Triage note:**
Pt: Omar Ruiz. Took naproxen 220 mg this morning. Denies dizziness.  
Vitals: BP 131/84, HR 80, Temp 98.7 F, O₂ 98%. PMH: hypertension.

**Expectation:**  
- “Current medications and frequency” lists **220 mg naproxen** only; **no effect phrase**.

**Results:**  
- GPT‑4o → PASS  
- Claude 3.5 → PASS  
- Gemini 2.5 Flash → PASS  
- Perplexity → PASS  
- GPT‑5 → PASS

**Notes:** No model invented an effect; minor wording differences acceptable and in‑scope.
