# Human Context Statement

This prompt system was authored by **SignalFrame**, a human prompt engineer in training.

It was developed over a focused **22-day period** as part of an intensive study in model control, hallucination suppression, and enterprise-grade instruction design.

It was written with **no prior legal background**, no law firm affiliation, and no employment in the AI industry—intentionally constrained to raw language reasoning and prompt logic alone.

---

## Purpose of This System

This system is being tested to evaluate its ability to:

- Extract **only** key obligations, restrictions, and renewal terms from legal and policy text  
- Reject any clause that is vague, speculative, or incomplete  
- Maintain strict formatting rules and fail-closed gracefully  
- Withstand hallucination pressure from both AI models and human adversaries

This is a **proof-of-concept system**—not a deployed product.  
It is under adversarial review to stress-test the **limits** of scalable prompt design without plugins, tools, or outside context.

---

## Testing Context

- No external tools, embeddings, or APIs were used  
- All instruction logic was derived from first principles  
- Constraint phrasing was iteratively designed and refined across multiple rounds of model-based and manual QA  
- This version has survived a multi-round, multi-model, multi-layer hallucination and formatting audit

If this system fails, I will rebuild it stronger.  
If it holds, I hope it sets a new benchmark for responsible, high-precision, accessible prompt systems.

## Final Statement

I built this system not to be clever, but to be *clear*.  
Not to predict, but to obey.  
Not to be exhaustive, but to be exact.

I welcome red team review not as judgment, but as apprenticeship.
